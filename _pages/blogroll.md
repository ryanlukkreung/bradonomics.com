In the days of yore, blogs used to have a blogroll. This was a magical place to share all the blogs you regularly followed and wanted to share with others. You might even have used your blogroll as a resource to open those blogs yourself, but now there are more convenient tools (RSS feed readers), such as [Feedly](http://feedly.com). If you haven't looked into RSS feed readers, [do seriously consider it](https://bradonomics.com/2018-10-10/).

Meanwhile, if you have a blog that you think will be of interest to me, send me an [e-mail](mailto:ryan@kullavanijaya.com). At the very least, I will read one or two posts. If I like it, I might even add your site below!

## Language Acquisition

[Beyond Language Learning](https://beyondlanguagelearning.com/): A Canadian friend's discoveries and commentaries on Automatic Language Growth, a natural language acquisition approach

[Dreaming Languages](https://dreaminglanguages.wordpress.com/): The adventures of a Spaniard learning Thai and discovering natural language acquisition approaches

## Religion

[Vultus Christi](https://vultuschristi.org/): Dom Mark '(Kirby)' is the prior of [Silverstream Priory](https://www.cenacleosb.org/) and has been writing on the Benedictine rule and spirituality since 2006.

[Inclinam aurem cordis tui](https://auremcordis.wordpress.com/): An oblate of Silverstream writes on the Benedictine rule and lay Benedictine experience.

[The Rad Trad](https://theradtrad.blogspot.com/): An American fellow touches on both Eastern and Western Catholic traditions.

## Finance

[Mr. Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/): MMM is probably one of the fathers of the FIRE movement. He might not have been the first, but he was my introduction. If you need a good primer, check out his [Getting Rich](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/) entry, which promises to take you from *Zero to Hero in One Blog Post*.

[JL Collins](https://jlcollinsnh.com/): JL Collins is another pioneer of the financial independence movement. If you don't have time to read his entire blog, consider checking out his book, *The Simple Path to Wealth*.

[Millenial Revolution](https://www.millennial-revolution.com): A young couple from Canada managaed to retire by 31 and now travel the world. [Check out](https://www.millennial-revolution.com/start-here/) how they managed to do so.

## Miscellaneous

[Study Hacks Blog](http://www.calnewport.com/blog/): Cal Newport touches on digital minimalism, deep work, and breaking free from Big Social. Cal is probably one of the reasons I am finally setting up this blog and slowly cutting back on Big Social.

[Bradonomics](http://bradonomics.com): Brad West touches on everything from single purpose devices to language learning. Like Cal Newport, Brad is one of the reasons I have a domain today.

[Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/articles): James Clear is the guy to go to for improving your habits and taking stock of your daily routine. Want to improve your performance? This is the place to start. Be warned, you could get lost for hours (or days) here.
