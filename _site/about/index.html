  <p>There is so much to say and, yet, so little time. Let’s get started:</p>

<h3 id="short-version">Short version</h3>

<p>I’m a language educator by training but often delve into a variety of other topics: cryptocurrencies, digital minimalism, travel, religion, monarchism, and more.</p>

<h3 id="slightly-longer-version">Slightly longer version</h3>

<p>I’m a Thai-American dual national with a degree in foreign language teaching. I used my degree to teach for several years in the States but am now resident in Southeast Asia, working in language education administration for a comprehensible input-based program (using the Automatic Language Growth approach) whilst exploring many of my other passions.</p>

<p>What might those be? For starters, I am a Romanian Greek-Catholic Christian and wholeheartedly embrace Eastern Christianity in its many forms. The Old Believers of Russia, for example, fascinate me, but so does the Armenian Apostolic Church. There is no shortage of Eastern (or Oriental) Christian history or practice that won’t captivate me. I am involved in several Roman Catholic parishes in my country but am also active in helping others to delve into the Christian East.</p>

<p>As well, I am a (former?) student of several northern kung fu styles: changquan, taijiquan, baguazhang, etc. And although I still dabble in these from time-to-time, I now more regularly train taichokun and am affiliated with <a href="http://taichokun.com">Taichokun Singapore</a>. This southern Chinese style of martial arts is quite traditional and has been a great source of joy to train over the last several years.</p>

<p>Beyond this, I am also an ardent monarchist and a royalist at heart. I suspect this is true of most every Thai. We love the Royal Family and are loyal supporters of the institution of the monarchy. The late King Rama IX was a source of national unity and was a true father to the Kingdom of Thailand. His son, H.M. King Rama X, is likewise Thailand’s father, and I wholeheartedly support him. Over the years, I have also developed a lasting fascination with other monarchies, particularly that of Spain. The Carlists, in particular, have captured my heart, and I have learned to deeply appreciate their “Dios, Patria, Rey, Fueros” ethos.</p>

<p>As indicated above, digital minimalism, deep work, cryptocurrencies, and the FIRE movement also capture my attention on a regular basis, and I may touch on these as time goes on. If any of this is of interest to you as well, please do reach out by e-mail.</p>

<h3 id="contact-me">Contact me</h3>
