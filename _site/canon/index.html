  <p>What follows is a collection of things that have shaped my thinking, things I email people, things I return to often. If you are familiar with a literary canon, it’s kinda like that.</p>

<h2 id="language">Language</h2>

<p>While I have read a great deal on language learning &amp; acquisition over the years, Dr. James Marvin Brown’s <a href="https://bradonomics.com/brown-autobiography/"><em>From the Outside In</em></a> has probably been one of the most influential. This autobiography is not purely about language acquisition but does provide the full story of how Dr. Brown arrived at his <em>Automatic Language Growth</em> approach (or system). If you’re short on time, skip ahead to <a href="https://bradonomics.com/brown-autobiography/#chapter-6">Chapter 6</a> and <a href="https://bradonomics.com/brown-autobiography/#chapter-7">Chapter 7</a>.</p>

<p>Brad West, a former AUA Thai student and ALG student, <a href="https://bradonomics.com/second-language/">documented his Thai acquisition experiences</a>. His experiences give hope to those wanting to learn a language through natural methods.</p>

<p>Dr. Jeff Brown, a Spanish professor, conducted a one-year experiment, during which he naturally acquired Egyptian Arabic predominantly through extensive listening and extensive experiences, entirely in the target language. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=illApgaLgGA">His hour-long documentary</a> follows the tutoring process as well as the full immersion experience in Egypt. I routinely send this to fellow language learners as well as potential teachers &amp; tutors.</p>

<h2 id="religion">Religion</h2>

<p>The Rad Trad’s <a href="https://theradtrad.blogspot.com/2013/08/book-review-banished-heart-origins-of.html">book review</a> of <em>The Banished Heart</em> ‘(by Dr. Geoffrey Hull)’ provides a short, but surprisingly complete, overview of the modern state of affairs in Western Christianity. Whenever I am next in the States, I hope to pick up the actual book.</p>
