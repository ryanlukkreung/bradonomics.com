What follows is a collection of things that have shaped my thinking, things I email people, things I return to often. If you are familiar with a literary canon, it's kinda like that.

## Language

While I have read a great deal on language learning & acquisition over the years, Dr. James Marvin Brown's [*From the Outside In*](https://bradonomics.com/brown-autobiography/) has probably been one of the most influential. This autobiography is not purely about language acquisition but does provide the full story of how Dr. Brown arrived at his *Automatic Language Growth* approach (or system). If you're short on time, skip ahead to [Chapter 6](https://bradonomics.com/brown-autobiography/#chapter-6) and [Chapter 7](https://bradonomics.com/brown-autobiography/#chapter-7).

Brad West, a former AUA Thai student and ALG student, [documented his Thai acquisition experiences](https://bradonomics.com/second-language/). His experiences give hope to those wanting to learn a language through natural methods.

Dr. Jeff Brown, a Spanish professor, conducted a one-year experiment, during which he naturally acquired Egyptian Arabic predominantly through extensive listening and extensive experiences, entirely in the target language. [His hour-long documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=illApgaLgGA) follows the tutoring process as well as the full immersion experience in Egypt. I routinely send this to fellow language learners as well as potential teachers & tutors.

## Religion

The Rad Trad's [book review](https://theradtrad.blogspot.com/2013/08/book-review-banished-heart-origins-of.html) of *The Banished Heart* '(by Dr. Geoffrey Hull)' provides a short, but surprisingly complete, overview of the modern state of affairs in Western Christianity. Whenever I am next in the States, I hope to pick up the actual book.
