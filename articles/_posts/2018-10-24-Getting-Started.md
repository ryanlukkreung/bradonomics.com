title: Getting Started in the Virtual World
---

Finally, we're here! After so many years of using social media, free blog sites (Xanga, anyone?), and other venues to share information, connect with friends, and make new acquaintances, it's time to branch off to my own domain. While the exact details have yet to be formulated, I'm hoping to use this site to discuss a couple of key topics.

Of greatest interest to the largest audience is likely to be life in Thailand. Over the last number of years, I've often heard from friends and others that I need to share various anecdotes in blog form. Whether that is about travel in region, experiences with local healthcare, or other interesting experiences, I have heard time and again the necessity to start writing down some of these things for others.

As well, being one of my great passions (and my current field of work), I hope to share some thoughts and materials here about language learning and teaching. Although I'm not a full-time Spanish or German teacher any longer, I do stay quite involved in the field and would like to connect with others that do the same. For those that already know me, it shouldn't be a surprise that these discussions will likely be focused on the Natural Approach, Automatic Language Growth, comprehensible input, and the like. Stay tuned for more information on this front.

Then, of course, we'll tackle some of the miscellaneous interests: martial arts, cryptocurrency, religion, and more. In particular, you'll likely find information on taichokun, baguazhang, PIVX (and other privacy/anonymity tokens), and Eastern & Oriental Christianity. As time goes on, these may develop into blogs of their own, but let's see what happens on my end and also what interest there is from you, the readers.

In the meantime, let's kick this off with a quick publication, and I'll get started on some actual blog posts as soon as possible!
