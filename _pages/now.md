A [now page](https://sivers.org/nowff) is an easy way to share a bird's eye view of my recent activities and adventures. Instead of posting constant updates on social media, this page will provide a simple overview of what I'm up to.

If you are interested in learning more about now pages, Derek Sivers explains how he started the [Now Pages Movement](https://nownownow.com/about).
