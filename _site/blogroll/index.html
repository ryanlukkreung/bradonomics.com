    <h1>Blogroll</h1>
  </header>

  <p>In the days of yore, blogs used to have a blogroll. This was a magical place to share all the blogs you regularly followed and wanted to share with others. You might even have used your blogroll as a resource to open those blogs yourself, but now there are more convenient tools (RSS feed readers), such as <a href="http://feedly.com">Feedly</a>. If you haven’t looked into RSS feed readers, <a href="https://bradonomics.com/web-feeds/">do seriously consider it</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, if you have a blog that you think will be of interest to me, send me an <a href="mailto:ryan@kullavanijaya.com">e-mail</a>. At the very least, I will read one or two posts. If I like it, I might even add your site below!</p>
